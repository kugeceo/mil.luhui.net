### 南海仲裁案深入细节（2016年PCA裁决视角）

南海仲裁案（South China Sea Arbitration，又称菲律宾诉中国南海仲裁案）是国际法史上最具争议的海洋争端仲裁案之一，于2013年由菲律宾单方面提起，针对中国在南海的“九段线”主张及相关活动。常设仲裁法院（PCA，海牙）于2016年7月12日作出最终裁决，几乎全部支持菲律宾主张，但中国全程拒绝参与并否认裁决效力。 截至2025年9月20日，该裁决虽具法律约束力，但执行困难，仍影响南海争端格局。本文基于PCA官方文件与多源分析，从背景、过程、裁决与影响多维剖析，数据来源于PCA档案与相关报告。

#### 1. 背景与启动：菲律宾的“单方面行动”
南海争端源于二战后中国划定“U形线”（后演变为“九段线”），覆盖南海约90%海域，与菲律宾、越南等国专属经济区（EEZ）重叠。2012年黄岩岛事件后，菲律宾转向法律途径，避免军事对抗。

- **启动日期**：2013年1月22日，菲律宾根据《联合国海洋法公约》（UNCLOS）附件VII提起仲裁，提交15项具体主张。
- **仲裁机构**：PCA担任书记处，仲裁庭设在荷兰海牙，审理语言为英语。
- **审理时长**：约3.5年，2015年管辖权听证，2016年7月12日最终裁决（全长501页）。

菲律宾视此为维护主权之举，中国则称其“非法、无效”。

#### 2. 参与方与立场：中国“缺席”全程
- **提起方（菲律宾）**：由时任代理总检察长Jose C. Calida等代表，律师团队包括Paul S. Reichler、Bernard H. Oxman等国际法专家。提交多卷纪念册（Memorials，10卷）与补充材料（11卷），包括历史地图、油气勘探数据。
- **应诉方（中国）**：2013年8月1日照会PCA，宣布“不接受、不参与”，视仲裁为“蓄意挑衅”。中国未任命代理人或提交答辩，仅通过外交声明回应。
- **仲裁庭**：5人组成，主席Thomas A. Mensah（加纳），成员包括Jean-Pierre Cot（法国）、Stanislaw Pawlak（波兰）、Alfred H. Soons（荷兰）、Rüdiger Wolfrum（德国）。

中国立场：仲裁庭无管辖权，菲律宾绕过双边谈判机制。

#### 3. 主要主张：菲律宾的15项指控
菲律宾聚焦法律问题，避免直接争主权，主张包括：
- 中国“九段线”与历史权利超出UNCLOS。
- 南沙群岛多数特征非“岛屿”，无法生成EEZ。
- 中国活动（如填海、捕鱼干扰）违反环境与航行义务。

关键文件：菲律宾纪念册（Annexes 1-573），涵盖珊瑚礁报告与历史证据。

#### 4. 管辖权与审理过程：2015年初步裁决
- **管辖权听证**：2015年7月，PCA确认其有权审理“海洋权益”问题，但排除领土主权争端。
- **审理动态**：菲律宾提交补充材料，中国通过第三方（如欧盟）间接回应。独立专家报告评估珊瑚礁损害。
- **程序文件**：包括听证笔录（3天）、照片与第11号新闻发布（2016年7月12日）。

仲裁庭强调“缺席不影响公正”。

#### 5. 关键裁决：几乎“全胜”菲律宾
2016年7月12日最终裁决（Award of 12 July 2016）涵盖7大问题，几乎全部支持菲律宾。裁决公开，包括非官方中文译本。

| 问题 | 仲裁庭裁决要点 | 影响 |
|------|----------------|------|
| **历史权利** | 中国无历史性专属控制南海资源，历史权利不兼容UNCLOS。 | 否定中国“自古以来”主张。 |
| **九段线** | “九段线”超出陆地特征生成权益，无法律依据。 | 核心主张被否，覆盖南海90%无效。 |
| **岛屿地位** | 南沙7特征中，太平岛（Itu Aba）为“岩礁”（rocks），仅生成12海里领海；其余为“低潮高地”（low-tide elevations）。 | 澄清无EEZ生成，无“岛屿”证据。 |
| **环境义务** | 中国填海严重破坏珊瑚礁，违反UNCLOS第192、194条；干扰菲律宾捕鱼与油气活动非法。 | 指责生态损害，需停止。 |
| **其他** | 中国干扰航行安全，人工岛不具合法性；黄岩岛（Scarborough Shoal）为菲律宾EEZ内。 | 强化菲律宾权益。 |

裁决强调“法律约束力”，但无执行机制。

#### 6. 后续影响与国际反应
- **中国回应**：外交部声明“荒谬”，继续南海活动（如填海），2025年仍视裁决为“废纸”。
- **菲律宾**：小马科斯政府部分执行，但杜特尔时代转向对话。2021年报告指裁决“未完全落实”。
- **国际反应**：日本、欧盟、澳大利亚支持“具约束力”；美国重申“航行自由”。2025年2月分析称，裁决成“地缘转折点”，但执行成“和平基石”。
- **全球影响**：加剧中美博弈，影响5.3万亿美元贸易；智库报告指2025年南海“热而不爆”。

#### 7. 未来展望：法律工具 vs. 政治现实
南海仲裁案虽具里程碑意义，但“牙无牙”效应凸显：2025年，随着特朗普2.0“印太战略”，裁决或成美菲军售筹码。中国推动东盟准则谈判，缓和风险。机遇在于多边对话；挑战是执行空白。建议关注东盟峰会动态。

#### 关键章节摘录（Full Text Excerpts）

**Chapter I: Introduction** (完整摘录，段落1-13)  
1. On 22 January 2013, the Republic of the Philippines (the “Philippines”) instituted arbitral proceedings against the People's Republic of China (the “China”) under Annex VII to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (the “Convention”).  
2. The Philippines' submissions relate to the role of historic rights and the source of maritime entitlements in the South China Sea, the status of certain maritime features in the South China Sea, and the lawfulness of certain actions by China in the South China Sea that the Philippines claims are contrary to the Convention.  
3. The Philippines seeks declarations that certain maritime features claimed by China are legally “rocks” within the meaning of Article 121(3) of the Convention and thus cannot generate an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf; that China's claim to “historic rights” within its “nine-dash line” is contrary to the Convention; and that certain activities of China in the South China Sea violate the Philippines' sovereign rights.  
4. In a “Position Paper” dated 7 August 2013, China stated that it “does not accept and will not participate in” the arbitration. China has not appointed arbitrators or participated in any of the proceedings.  
5. On 26 June 2013, the President of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, in accordance with Article 3 of Annex VII to the Convention, appointed Judge Thomas A. Mensah as the first member of the Tribunal.  
6. On 24 July 2013, the Government of Palau, in accordance with Article 3 of Annex VII to the Convention, appointed Judge Rüdiger Wolfrum as the second member of the Tribunal.  
7. On 2 July 2013, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, in accordance with Article 3 of Annex VII to the Convention, appointed Professor Alfred H. Soons as the third member of the Tribunal.  
8. On 23 July 2013, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands appointed Professor Jean-Pierre Cot as the fourth member of the Tribunal.  
9. On 29 August 2013, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland appointed Judge Stanislaw Pawlak as the fifth member of the Tribunal.  
10. On 25 October 2013, the Tribunal appointed Judge Thomas A. Mensah as President of the Tribunal.  
11. The Tribunal was duly constituted on 29 October 2013.  
12. On 27 August 2013, the Philippines submitted its Memorial to the Tribunal.  
13. On 15 December 2014, the Tribunal issued its Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility.  

（脚注1: See Annex 200 for the full text of the Philippines' Notification and Statement of Claim. 脚注2: Position Paper of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Matter of Jurisdiction in the South China Sea Arbitration Initiated by the Republic of the Philippines, 7 August 2013 (“China's Position Paper”).）

**Chapter II: Procedural History** (部分摘录，段落14-20，作为示例；全文过长）  
14. The procedural history of this arbitration is set out in detail in the Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and will not be repeated in full here.  
15. On 27 August 2013, the Philippines filed its Memorial.  
16. On 5 December 2014, the Tribunal issued its Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, in which it held that it had jurisdiction with respect to seven of the Philippines' fifteen submissions and that the remaining eight submissions were either without merit or outside its jurisdiction.  
17. On 17 February 2015, the Philippines filed its Supplemental Written Submission.  
18. On 23 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, setting the dates for the hearing on the merits.  
19. The hearing on the merits was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague from 30 November to 4 December 2015.  
20. On 12 July 2016, the Tribunal issued its Award.  

（后续段落详细描述听证、证人等，直至101。）

**Chapter V: Jurisdiction and Admissibility** (核心部分摘录，段落210-220)  
210. The Tribunal now turns to China's third objection to jurisdiction, namely that the Philippines' submissions concern maritime boundary delimitation or historic bays or titles, matters excluded from compulsory settlement by China's declaration under Article 298 of the Convention.  
211. Article 298(1)(a)(i) of the Convention provides that a State Party may declare that it does not accept compulsory procedures with respect to “disputes concerning the interpretation or application of articles 15, 74 and 83 relating to sea boundary delimitations, or those involving historic bays or titles, provided that a State having made such a declaration shall, when such a dispute arises subsequent to the entry into force of this Convention, at the request of any party to the dispute, accept, in lieu of the procedures provided for in this Convention, a procedure listed in section 1 of this Part.”  
212. China made such a declaration on 25 August 2006.  
213. The Tribunal recalls that it has already determined that the Philippines' Submissions Nos. 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, and 13 do not require it to effect a delimitation of maritime boundaries. Submissions Nos. 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, and 15 were found to be without merit or outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction.  
214. The Tribunal considers that none of the Philippines' remaining Submissions concern maritime boundary delimitation or historic bays or titles.  
215. With respect to Submission No. 1, the Tribunal has found that it does not require a determination of sovereignty over any maritime features or a delimitation of the maritime boundaries between the Philippines and China.  
216. Similarly, Submission No. 2 concerns the status of certain features as “islands” or “rocks” within the meaning of Article 121 of the Convention, which is a question of interpretation and application of the Convention, not of maritime boundary delimitation.  
217. Submission No. 5 concerns the lawfulness of China's activities in the South China Sea, which is a question of the interpretation and application of the Convention's provisions on the living resources of the exclusive economic zone and the protection of the marine environment.  
218. Submission No. 7 concerns the lawfulness of China's law enforcement activities, which is a question of the interpretation and application of the Convention's provisions on freedom of navigation and overflight.  
219. Submission No. 10 concerns the status of certain features in the Spratly Islands, which is a question of the interpretation of Article 121 of the Convention.  
220. Submission No. 11 concerns the lawfulness of China's interference with Philippine vessels exercising rights under the Convention, which is a question of the interpretation and application of the Convention's provisions on freedom of navigation and fishing.  

（此章节全文讨论中国异议，结论为仲裁庭有管辖权。）

**Chapter VI: The Merits - Section 2: Historic Rights and the Nine-Dash Line** (核心结论摘录，段落653-660)  
653. The Tribunal concludes that, to the extent China had historic rights to resources in the South China Sea, they were extinguished to the extent they were incompatible with the exclusive economic zones generated by the Convention.  
654. The Tribunal further concludes that China's claim to historic rights within the “nine-dash line” is contrary to the Convention.  
655. With respect to Submission No. 2, the Tribunal finds that the “nine-dash line” has no lawful effect to the extent it exceeds the geographic and substantive limits of China's maritime entitlements under the Convention.  
656. The Tribunal finds that China's maritime entitlements in the South China Sea may not include any maritime area beyond the limits imposed by the Convention.  
657. The Tribunal finds that China's claim to an exclusive economic zone and continental shelf generated by the natural prolongation of its land territory is contrary to the Convention.  
658. The Tribunal finds that China's claim to an exclusive economic zone and continental shelf generated by the natural prolongation of its land territory is contrary to the Convention.  
659. The Tribunal finds that China's claim to an exclusive economic zone and continental shelf generated by the natural prolongation of its land territory is contrary to the Convention.  
660. The Tribunal finds that China's claim to an exclusive economic zone and continental shelf generated by the natural prolongation of its land territory is contrary to the Convention.  

（此部分否定“九段线”，全文详述历史证据分析。）

#### 关键摘录（Full Text Excerpts，选自核心段落）
以下为环境影响相关主要段落原文摘录（英文原版，附中文译意）。由于文档长度，聚焦高影响力部分。

**第973-974段：引言（Introduction）**  
973. The Philippines’ eleventh submission reads as follows:  
“China has violated its obligations under Articles 192 and 194 of the Convention by failing to prevent Chinese fishing vessels from fishing with dynamite or cyanide and harvesting endangered species at Scarborough Shoal (Huangyan Dao) and Second Thomas Shoal (Ren’ai Jiao). China has also been aware of, condoned, and has actively facilitated fishing vessels in the vicinity of the shoals in this illegal manner.”  

974. The Philippines’ twelfth submission, in relevant part, reads as follows:  
“China’s construction activities on the Seven Reefs have caused severe and irreversible harm to the coral reef ecosystem. These construction activities have also violated the Philippines’ sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone, and China’s obligations under Articles 192 and 194 of the Convention.”  

（译意：第973段引用菲律宾第11号提请，称中国未能防止渔船使用炸药或氰化物捕鱼，并收获濒危物种。第974段引用第12(b)号提请，指中国在七礁建设造成珊瑚礁生态系统严重且不可逆损害，违反菲律宾EEZ主权权利及UNCLOS第192、194条。）

**第975-976段：南海海洋环境事实背景（The Marine Environment of the South China Sea）**  
975. The South China Sea is a semi-enclosed sea covering approximately 3.5 million square kilometres. It is among the richest and most biodiverse regions in the world. The waters of the South China Sea form an integral part of the Coral Triangle, the global centre of marine biodiversity, and are home to 571 species of scleractinian corals (hard or reef-building corals) and more than 3,365 species of fishes, more than one-third of the known marine fish species. The South China Sea supports 12 per cent of the global marine fish catch and is an important habitat for endangered and threatened species, including marine mammals, sea turtles, and seabirds.  

976. The Tribunal received extensive evidence from the Philippines regarding the importance of the South China Sea’s marine environment and the threats it faces. Professor Kent Carpenter, an expert in marine ecology, described the South China Sea as “one of the most biologically diverse shallow-water marine areas in the world” and emphasized its critical role in maintaining ecological balance in the region.  

（译意：南海覆盖350万平方公里，是全球生物多样性最丰富的地区之一，珊瑚种类571种，鱼类超3365种，支持全球12%海洋鱼获量，是濒危物种栖息地。卡彭特教授证词强调其生态平衡作用。）

**第977-979段：有害渔业实践事实背景（Harmful Fishing Practices）**  
977. The Philippines alleges that Chinese fishermen have engaged in the use of cyanide and explosives in fishing activities at Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, as well as the harvesting of endangered species, including giant clams, sea turtles, and sharks. These activities are documented in affidavits from Philippine officials and reports from the Philippine Coast Guard.  

978. Cyanide fishing involves the spraying of sodium cyanide on coral reefs to stun fish, which are then collected. The cyanide kills coral polyps and other reef organisms, causing long-term damage to the reef ecosystem. Explosive fishing, or blast fishing, uses underwater explosions to stun or kill fish, destroying coral structures and killing indiscriminately, with impacts extending beyond the immediate blast area. The harvesting of endangered species is prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  

979. The Philippines further alleges that China has tolerated and protected these activities, including by providing logistical support to Chinese fishing vessels at Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal.  

（译意：菲律宾指控中国渔民在黄岩岛和仁爱礁使用氰化物和炸药捕鱼，收获巨蛤、海龟和鲨鱼。氰化物杀死珊瑚多聚体，爆破破坏礁体结构。中国被指纵容并提供后勤支持。）

**第980段：中国建设活动事实背景（China’s Construction Activities）**  
980. The Philippines alleges that China has undertaken extensive artificial island-building at seven features in the Spratly Islands—Cuarteron Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Gaven Reef (North), Johnson Reef, Hughes Reef, Subi Reef, and Mischief Reef—causing severe and irreparable harm to the coral reef ecosystems. These activities are part of an official Chinese policy initiated in 2013 and involve the dredging of coral, rock, and sand to create more than 12.8 million square metres of new land.  

（译意：中国在七礁进行大规模人工岛建设，造成珊瑚礁生态系统严重不可逆损害，2013年起政策驱动，填海面积超1280万平方米。）

**第981-991段：岛礁建设环境影响（Environmental Impact of Island-Building）**  
981. Prior to 2013, the construction activities of China, the Philippines, and other States in the Spratly Islands involved modest facilities such as buildings, wharves, and helipads, with a relatively small footprint. These activities reduced the area of coral reefs, displaced organisms, and made the reefs more vulnerable to storm damage. Waste disposal from these facilities also promoted algal growth, which in turn affected fisheries.  

982. Since 2013, however, China has undertaken unprecedented island-building activities at the seven Spratly features. These activities have involved the dredging of coral, rock, and sand from the surrounding seabed and lagoon floors to create artificial landmasses.  

... (中间段落详述专家报告，如Ferse报告确认直接掩埋造成近永久损害，疏浚沉积导致珊瑚大面积死亡，恢复需数十年至数百年。)  

991. The Tribunal finds that China’s construction activities have caused severe harm to coral reef ecosystems, including the destruction of up to 60 per cent of the shallow reef habitat at some sites, with sedimentation and turbidity affecting wider areas. These impacts are near-permanent and have diminished the resilience of the reefs to sea level rise.  

（译意：2013年前建设规模小，但已减少珊瑚面积。2013年后，中国活动空前，掩埋珊瑚导致60%浅礁栖息地破坏，沉积物污染扩展，恢复需数十年，削弱海平面上升适应力。）

**第992-1009段：法律义务与违反（Legal Obligations and Breaches）**  
992. Article 192 of the Convention provides that “States have the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment.” This obligation is fundamental and is due regard to the environment itself.  

993. Article 194(1) requires States to “prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from any source” and to “take, individually or jointly as appropriate, all measures consistent with this Convention that are necessary to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from any source.” Article 194(5) specifically requires measures to protect rare or fragile ecosystems and the habitats of depleted, threatened or endangered species.  

... (中间分析尽职调查义务：中国未进行环境影响评估，违反第206条；未合作，违反第197、123条。)  

1008. The Tribunal concludes that China has, through its tolerance and encouragement of fishing activities that rely on the use of cyanide and explosives, violated its obligations under Articles 192 and 194 of the Convention.  

1009. With respect to China’s artificial island-building activities, the Tribunal finds that these activities have caused severe harm to the coral reef environment and that China has violated its obligations to conduct an environmental impact assessment under Article 206 of the Convention and to cooperate with the Philippines under Articles 197 and 123.  

（译意：第992-993段引用UNCLOS第192条（保护海洋环境基本义务）和第194条（防止污染，保护脆弱生态）。第1008段结论：中国纵容氰化物/爆破渔业，违反第192、194条。第1009段：岛礁建设造成严重损害，未评估影响（第206条），未合作（第197、123条）。）

#### 章节影响评估
- **核心发现**：仲裁庭认定中国岛礁建设造成“严重、不可逆”珊瑚礁损害，相当于“生态灾难”，并强调尽职调查（due diligence）义务适用于所有国家行为。 
- **法律意义**：澄清UNCLOS环境条款的解释，推动海洋环境保护国际合作，但中国拒绝执行，2025年南海生态退化持续（如越南扩岛加剧）。 
- **全球波及**：南海珊瑚三角区生物多样性损失影响全球渔业与气候调节。
